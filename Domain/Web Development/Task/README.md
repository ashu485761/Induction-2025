# Web Development Task

In this task, you'll learn about web development by creating a responsive book selling landing page.

## Before proceeding to the task

Now, anytime any changes take place in the main repository, your forked repository must pull those changes from the main repository before it can push other changes to the main repository.

1. Go to the [Enigma repository](https://github.com/EnigmaVSSUT/Induction-2025) and copy the repo address just like you copied your forked repo's address in task 1.

2. Open gitbash in your cloned repo and type:

```
git remote add upstream <copied repo address>
```

This adds a reference to the main repository from which we can pull the updates.

3. Now enter:

```
git pull upstream main
```

This should now pull all the changes that have been made to the main repo from merging the pull requests.
